Moving from SharePoint Fully Trusted Code Solutions to SharePoint Add-ins
=========================================================================

Abstract
--------
While still supported, the time is now to start moving away from SharePoint solutions written using fully trusted code (FTC) and towards the SharePoint Add-in model (formerly called the App Model). This session is all about covering tried and real world patterns & practices for moving from classic SharePoint farm solutions to the SharePoint add-in model. After explaining the high-level changes and mindset adjustments you need to make, we will look at some common examples. Finally you'll be left with a wealth of resources that you can refer back to when making this mindshift from FTC to add-ins.
